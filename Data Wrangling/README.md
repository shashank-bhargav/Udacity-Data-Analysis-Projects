# Project 3: OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling with SQL #

## Name: Shashank bhargav ##

### Map Area: Pune, Maharashtra, India as i have spent a lot of time in this city. ###

### Location: Pune, India ###

## 1. Data Audit

### Unique Tags ###

Looking at the XML file, I found that it uses different types of tags. And also my filesize is quite large for myPC so i
sampled the data.Then parsed the Pune,India dataset using ElementTree and count number of the unique tags.
mapparser.py is used to count the numbers of unique tags.

'member': 195

'nd': 55896

'node': 47133

'osm': 1

'relation': 72

'tag': 10203

'way': 8998

### Patterns in the Tags

The "k" value of each tag contain different patterns. Using tags.py , 
I created 3 regular expressions to check
for certain patterns in the tags.
I have counted each of four tag categories:

"lower" : 9939 , for tags that contain only lowercase letters and are valid,

"lower_colon" : 260 , for otherwise valid tags with a colon in their names,

"problemchars" : 0 , for tags with problematic characters, and

"other" : 4 , for other tags that do not fall into the other three categories.


## Problems Encountered in the Map

### Street address inconsistencies

The main problem we encountered in the dataset is the street name inconsistencies. 
Below are the old names corrected with better names.
Using audit.py , i updated the names.

**Abbreviations**

Rd -> Road

LowerCase

pune -> Pune

Misspelling

socity -> Society

Hindi names

Marg -> Path

City name inconsistencies

Using audit.py , we update the names

LowerCase

puna -> Pune

Misspelling

poona -> Pune

## 3. Data Overview

### File sizes:

pune_india.osm: 307.3 MB

nodes_csv: 3.9 MB

nodes_tags.csv: 16.9 KB

ways_csv: 549.1 KB

ways_nodes.csv: 1.3 MB

ways_tags.csv: 316.8 KB

pune_sample : 10.3 MB

pune.db: 7.0 MB

**Number of nodes:**

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes

*Output:*
47133

**Number of ways:**

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ways

*Output:*
8998

**Number of unique users:**

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(e.uid))

FROM (SELECT uid FROM nodes UNION ALL SELECT uid FROM ways) e;

*Output:*
276

**Top contributing users:**

sqlite> SELECT e.user, COUNT(*) as num

FROM (SELECT user FROM nodes UNION ALL SELECT user FROM ways) e

GROUP BY e.user

ORDER BY num DESC

LIMIT 10;

*Output:*

Sramesh : 1918

Praveeng : 1904

Shiva05 : 1740

Anushapyata : 1616

Kranthikumar : 1589

Harishk : 1436

Saikumar : 1337

**Number of users contributing only once:**

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*)

FROM

(SELECT e.user, COUNT(*) as num

FROM (SELECT user FROM nodes UNION ALL SELECT user FROM ways) e

GROUP BY e.user

HAVING num=1) u;

*Output:*
103

## 4. Additional Data Exploration

**Biggest religion:**

sqlite> SELECT nodes_tags.value, COUNT(*) as num

FROM nodes_tags

JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='place_of_worship') i

ON nodes_tags.id=i.id

WHERE nodes_tags.key='religion'

GROUP BY nodes_tags.value

ORDER BY num DESC

LIMIT 1;

*Output:*
Hindu : 4

**Popular cuisines**

sqlite> SELECT nodes_tags.value, COUNT(*) as num

FROM nodes_tags

JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='restaurant') i

ON nodes_tags.id=i.id

WHERE nodes_tags.key='cuisine'

GROUP BY nodes_tags.value

ORDER BY num DESC;

*Output:*
Barbecue: 15 

## Conclusion

The OpenStreetMap data of Pune is of fairly reasonable quality but the typo errors caused by 
the human inputs are significant. I have cleaned a significant amount of the data which is 
required for this project. But, there are lots of improvement needed in the dataset. The dataset 
contains very less amount of additional information such as amenities, tourist attractions, 
popular places and other useful interest. The dataset contains very old information which is now 
incomparable to that of Google Maps or Bing Maps.So, I think there are several opportunities for 
cleaning and validation of the data in the future.

### Additional Suggestion and Ideas

#### Control typo errors
We can build parser which parse every word input by the users.We can make some rules or 
patterns to input data which users follow everytime to input their data. This will also restrict 
users input in their native language.We can develope script or bot to clean the data regularly 
or certain period. Also we can give user of the maps to authenticate the data on the map.

#### More information

The tourists or even the city people search map to see the basic amenities provided in the 
city or what are the popular places and attractions in the city or near outside the city. So, 
the users must be motivated to also provide these informations in the map.If we can provide 
these informations then there are more chances to increase views on the map because 
many people directly enter the famous name on the map.
